Printable vibration dampers
===========================

Printable vibration dampers for nema 17 step motors to reduce the frame vibrations for 3D printers.


Print 2pcs of "Vibration damper 4mm.stl", get 1 piece of rubber O-ring 25x3mm and superglue it in between the plastic flanges.
The O-rings you can get from your local hydraulic maintenance shop and should cost you less than an euro. I used round ones, but flat could probably hold better, because it would have more contact with the glue.


To ease with assembly, I have included a printable file with hole dimensions corresponding to Nema 17 motors.

TODO:
Prepare a CAD drawing to make these out of plywood or metal.
(I'm way better with CAD drawings)
